    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> The Brown Cow is a fix for extreme constipation. I learned the recipe for a Brown Cow from a short stint working in a nursing home. I have taught many nurses this recipe since, and have heard many success stories. The Brown Cow is made with over the counter ingredients, and the order does not matter much at all.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <li>
        <ul>1 cup prune juice</ul>
        <ul>1 cup apple juice</ul>
        <ul>10mg Milk of Magnesia</ul>
        <ul>1 tablespoon of butter</ul>
    </li>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <li>
        <ol>Put 1 tablespoon of butter into a cup and microwave for 30 seconds or until melted.</ol>
        <ol>Add apple juice and prune juice into the cup and stir.</ol>
        <ol>Add the milk of magnesia and stir vigorously.</ol>
        <ol>Drink Brown Cow and stay near the restroom.</ol>
    </li>
